Having already explored the menu, we decided to waste no more time and ordered \"Panco Crumbed Bengali Fish Fry\". It was delicious. Served with mustard chutney, it had fish coated with bread crumbs and served as the perfect appetizer.Coming to the main course, it was always decided to try their very-much-talked-about dish, \"Daab Chingri\".

The seating and the restroom were clean.Service - We were in a hurry and chose this place because my friend wanted to eat south Indian cuisine and thought they would take lesser time to serve compared to the burger and pizza joints around.\\xa0The most lethargic staff I have seen in a long time. We ordered simple readily available dishes such as idli and dosas and they took forever to serve it, all this while we we were requesting them to hurry up.\\xa0Price - Considering the taste of the dishes served, it is highly expensive.Taste - I tried the following items.Idli - Dismissable. My north Indian friend enjoyed it as it tasted better than idlis available there.

And I'll tell you whyMr. Hyde, it's diner, is a trip you take down the memory lane to an almost-there premium dosa centre of the 90's with equally almost-there on-their-feet-but-not-really waiting staff. Service is slow, so is the time on this first floor sitting area.Dr. Jekyll however saves the day. It's ground floor order-stand-devour-leave model is nothing short of a well oiled machine. It's always crowded (in a good way) and hustle seems to be the vibe as well as unwritten agreement in the community which recharges itself here. With pupil dilating coffee, an unsanctioned-sutta corner (is there any other kind?) and a refreshingly munchy snack corner, just experiencing the vibe here is worth the visit.Interestingly, while spending 20 mins with Mr. Hyde feels like an eternity, spending 20 mins in Dr. Jekyll's company feels like 5 mins.

All Veg.I got stoked on how fresh and intense the flavours were. All the more better thing is it being pocket friendly. We had a full meal for 500 bucks. That's bang on!What's better? They listen!

To an extent I have explored 1000+ restaurants in US while living there and experienced good food. But the TBW has taken it to another level. What they do with a simple Maggie is mind blowing. Each flavor is outstanding. They know what they doing in terms of skill and combined with passion it makes a once in a lifetime experience.Okay, their fries were insanely tasteful. I kept thinking how you can disrupt the everyday food and make you use fingers to get the last bite (quite literally I did that).Now moving on, if you are lucky you can even get your hands on the limited edition big bello burger.

It had the perfect amount of flavour and yet though it was deep fried it was not overly crunchy making it a perfect starter to the meal.2.

The whole vibe takes you a step back in time and making you nostalgic. The two floors of the restaurant, located in an old bungalow a little away from the main road, have decidedly different vibes: the terrace works as a tropical oasis with soothing sound of water in the background while the first floor has the look and feel of a cosy British smoking room from the colonial era with its wood furniture and flooring, gramophone, old-timey telephone and grandfather clock. The music is kept at a low volume and consists of smooth jazz. The menu at Punkah House is laced with innovative cocktails infused with flowers, herbs and spices and the food is a rich amalgam of the old and the modern while paying a rich tribute to cuisines from the subcontinentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s culinary past - think colonial...                                        read more'],\n",

I happened to visit them on a rainy Sunday and had a great time treating myself to some amazing food fare. Foxnut Jhalmuri and Karachi spiced lotus root are my picks amongst the quarter plates. These served as a perfect accompaniment with the cocktails we ordered in. They have some brilliant Gin based concoctions to offer, their take on Gin and Tonic is a must try! In the small plates, we tried a variety of stuff, the sweet potato chops and Mushroom crumble were my absolute favorites.

Rather he had the audacity to tell me to take his picture and the GST number etc, and do what so ever i wish to do with it.People who need chance will be humble and not Audacious.Let me know if someone thinks why i should not knock on consumers...                                        read more\"]),\n",

Fast forward to today, I went to this newly opened Irish House outlet at RMZ Galleria mall. The location is amazing, you can see this while your trip to the airport to Bangalore's main city. This is the third outlet they have opened in Bangalore. Amazing crafted tables, pleasant view from the glass window, polite and amicable staff will please you when you enter this place.We started off with some amazing cocktails and finger food to start our journey. Some of my personal recommendations are pail of shrimp popcorn. Tiny shrimps deep-fried into perfect popcorn, the great Irish fish n chips, and old fashioned onion rings. Fish and chips is the clear winner among them. One of the finest fish and chips I have ever tried. Shrimp popcorn was perfect to go with our cocktails. this crunchy and nibbles of prawns deep-fried to...                                        read more\"],\n",

We ordered a few drinks and a lot of food since we were quite hungry. The price is definitely on a higher side but everything is so worth it! We started off with a couple of beer and cocktails. I went for the Fresh Red Head which was a watermelon based cocktail and perfect for the weather and the dishes we ordered.1. The Great Irish Fish N Chips - One of my favorite dishes of the day. The fish was crunchy yet lightly battered on the outside and soft and sucullent on the inside. The chips and tartar was just PERFECT!2. Double Chicken Ghost Crunch - If you are a burger lover, definitely do not miss this. This is a gigantic double chicken layered burger with loads of stuff in between. Tangy, spicy and flavourful, this one was so good.3. Fried Fish Fight - a fish burger may seem off putting but this is not at all...                                        read more'],\n",

They could have offered a dip or so.The Steak was well cooked & had a unique taste to it. Could have been hotter considering the veggies were all cold but definitely not undercooked. Overall I loved it.The bacon pasta was delicious! There's lots of bacon & one can relish it till the very end. Bacon lovers will love it for sure.And finally the freshly made apple pie with ice cream went well with the steak & pasta.P.S: The steaks need to be hotter & that would definitely be well appreciated.\"]),\n",

So on a cloudy Sunday afternoon I decided to check this place out as I was craving some Andhra biryani. Well this place is on the 3rd floor of the Nandhana Hotel and there is no sign advertising it anywhere! Strange. Once i entered, I was surprised they had a full fledged bar! And the best part - they accept food coupons for beer as well! Well that's a good thing as I had 6 months of coupons left (I never use them and don't know how to cancel it!). So it was set then! I was pleased I got to have my customary Sunday afternoon beer(s)!Now comes the food. I asked for Chicken 65 as its truly Andhra. I was shocked by what I got. 4 bony pieces which was on the verge of becoming cold. No side salad, no lime, no onion. Ok, lets try Guntur Chicken next is what i said. Again, bad idea.

The avocado toast with beets was a little alright comparitively.Also please a special mention goes to the churros! Splendid. Ive been eating the wrong churros all my life!

First level in closed environs of a AC and second one on top with open air seating. Both having there own bar counters. Both levels have a terrific ambience with some foot tapping music. It sets the mood for a good time.Then once you are comfortably seated in one of the tables , the attending staff comes in a jiffy and makes you comfortable. We chose to sit in the open air rooftop to enjoy the blissful evening weather of bangalore. As this is a craft beer place we first ordered a sampler of there beers.

It could be made a lot more flavourful.Because 90% of the dishes are whole foods plant based, the meal is filling, yet feels nice and kind on the stomach. One can stuff themselves with the clean, vegetable rich dishes and not feel any regrets after the meal.ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a bit of a pain to reach this place because of all the road work happening on Hosur Road, but on a Sunday afternoon, the traffic isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t so bad.

The cheese were stuffed on the paratha, unlike other restaurants, who grate the cheese over. The paratha was hot & the cheese went good with it. The hot red chutney went good with the chilki cheese paratha. The spicy paneer paratha was good on it's way. The paneer stuffing was spicy and the paratha was delicious.

I know enough to know Dum has caramalized brown color. I don't how they managed to achieve this color. I am a spicy eater, but there are some thing which taste better when spicy, and there are some which don't. There were lots of chillies in this food and it didn't taste good. I understand the soup being spicy, but the problem was, it was ONLY spicy. No other taste. About Biryani, I will refrain myself from criticizing any further. Chicken was dry beyond limit. I gave up after 5 or 6 spoonfuls. Idea of eating colored rice was dreadful. Their watery Raita could not save their Biryani as well. I thought Masala Papad would save the day, but NO. Masala was too salty, so no save on that front too.Very disappointing order. I ate bread with Tea after this.

Green papaya salad, a spicy salad made from shredded unripe papaya. The dish combines the five main tastes of the local cuisine: sour lime, hot chili, salty, savory fish sauce, and sweetness added by palm sugar. Despite the use of papaya, which one may think of as sweet, this salad is actually savory. When not yet ripe, papaya does not have a tangy flavor. The texture is crisp and firm, sometimes to the point of crunchiness.Crispy Chilli vegetables is a must try its a Chinese style dish prepared with assorted vegetables, sliced and fried crisp, tossed in a tangy chilli sauce with pickled ginger.

We had the whole wheat spaghetti in pesto which was too salty for our taste. But a great meal. Would definitely recommend it.

It is not a huge space though, but there are two sections, one within the main space along with the products and also the semi open space, which offers a little more privacy. Seating is comfortable and the design asthetics takes it to further into the menu design, plates etc.The all veg menu is interesting and offers a lot of choices from light to more substantial eats.We started of with a Pineapple shikanji and it was brilliant. No added ice/sugar and naturally sweet fruit was offset with the shikanji masala, perfectly.

But Alas!We first started off with the Pizzachos. This was okay but not great! It was Nachos with like an Indian curry. Next up had the Aranchini. This one had a lot less rice and not anywhere close to the authentic Aranchini. We had the Grilled Vegetable with Cheese Crust pizza. Again, it was kind of a let down. I've definitely had much much better pizzas! On the whole, the place is quite expensive but definitely not worth it! For the same amount, we could have definitely had much better food! I really wanted to try the Live Pasta wheel and we were told that, cause it's New Year's Eve, it wasn't available. However, the another table was served with it! Quite disappointed on the whole though!\"],\n",

It's essentially nachos made of pizza dough.Ã¢\\x80Â¢ All kinda of pizzas! My favourite would be good old Margherita pizza which tasted impeccable.They have different kinds of pizzas to offer in shapes, sizes and customisable toppings.Among the dessert I urge one to try the death by chocolate and the chocolate mousse.The usp of this place however apart from the lipsmacking food is the fact that the owner personally comes to each and every table to take the order as well as give suggestions when need be.Do give this place a try! :)\"],\n",

They were good (3/5).I liked the wheat malbar paratha here. Baked well nice flavour of garlic and butter.(4/5)But the cost is on the higher end I can say.

The Berry Trap was definitely the better tasting out of the two. Loved the creme brulÃƒÂ© anglaise. But sadly they weren't cooked well which was slightly disappointing considering the amount of time it took for them to get prepared.It took them about 45-50 minutes to get the first one out and another 40 minutes for the second one.

Its so cheesy and till the end of the bite, i enjoyed the real taste of spinach and corn which is mixed with cheese.

For Mains, we ordered chopsuey and some Hara Kheema Pizza, both of which stood out with their flavourful appeal and spot on presentation. I also had a Mutton Dalcha for the first time in my life and boy was it a delight!The ball was knocked out off the park by their unique se5 of desserts-Kahlua Khaja and Shrikhand Brulee.

Reasonable price too.But I dint like the packaging of soup. They dint give in strong plastic case. It was a normal plastic container so by the time it reaches, it wasn't hot enough. Apart from that noodles packaging was good.Coming to food. Manchow Soup tasted good. But fried noodles for soup was burnt actually. Hakka noodles was overcooked with alomost no taste. But quantity is more than enough for a person.The only thing I liked is death by Chocolate jar. Since I wanted to have some dessert so I ordered that jar along with food.

The owner, Mr. Sudarshan, was very glad about the positive experience we had and suggested some sweets for desert. The Rasgulla with Rabadi and Rasmalai were really good. Apparently, they serve special sweet item on weekends and to favour my luck, it was a Saturday.Amazing hospitality from the staff and hygenic environment.

I found the shutters only partly raised and cleaning of the shop in progress. I was told that the shop is not yet open. I requested them that I only needed to pick up some Mysore Pak and had come all the way from Mumbai. They rudely asked me to come back after one hour if I wanted their Mysore pak. I had other commitments and hence had to leave empty handed and disappointed. I asked them to learn customer service from other sweet shops such as Sri Krishna Sweets and Shree Adyar Ananda Bhavan. The Venkateshwara sweet shop may have the most tasty Mysore Pak anywhere but SRI VENKATESHWARA SWEET MEAT SHOP HAS THE WORST STAFF AND A TERRIBLE ATTITUDE WHEN IT COMES TO TREATING CUSTOMERS.

All were good. The beauty of their Mysore Paak is that it's very soft, laden with loadful of ghee and above all, very balanced in sweetness as opposed to the version we generally get elsewhere. So you will be tempted to have more as you eat each bit and it won't take a toll perhaps due to the purity of their ingredients.

The paratha also came with butter and thick curd.The chilli Milli paneer tikka was very soft, and the spices were perfectly balanced. The slightly milder stuffing and tangy, hot masala at the top of paneer gave it perfect look as well as taste.Mushroom pepper fry was also to the point.

Out of all, I loved LA Trappe Tripel and Westmalle Dubbel.If you love fruitful beer, La Trappe is the clear choice, It gives the aroma of peach and apricot fruit.

So, I went in a group of about 7-8 individuals after work and was completely awestruck by the wonderful collection of beers that they have. As of now, they don't have any brewed beers but will be launched soon, however their bottled beer collection is one of a kind. They have all the varieties available which goes well with the array of appetizers that they provide. Moreover, the staff is well versed with the beers and help you decide which beer to order based on your taste preferences. Most of the appetizers are on the spicier side but that's what goes perfectly well with chilled beers. They also have a great variety of cocktails which you can give a try if you're not a beer person. Located over 2 floors, I'd recommend that you sit on the terrace especially during the evenings as it makes for a wonderful setting. The lights are dim and it makes for a great romantic option.

Tilt is pretty new in the Indiranagar locality but did not fail to impress. They have a great range of imported craft beer to serve that any beer lover would definitely not want to miss. Along with their varied drinks menu, I was also impressed with their food options. Tried the Spicy fried idli and Veg Mongolian Rice. Though I'm not a fan of spicy food, these two items we tried was the perfect amount of spicy, just like how I would like spice in my food. We ended our lunch with the Choco Lava Cake served with vanilla ice cream. A filling lunch indeed. The next time I'm at Tilt, would love to explore their cocktails. Looking forward to my next visit.Cheers to team Tilt for a great Sunday lunch.\"],\n",

I also tried Barbar, Sloeber and Gouden Carolus Hopnsinjoor. The latter is a blond and has a bitter after taste. I liked Barbar because it had a fruity aroma and no bitter aftertaste.

They have simple seating and a decent sized menu. The service is great and the staff are friendly.Coming to he food, their starters in chicken and veg are great. I tried their Chicken, Mutton, prawns and Veggies like their Soya, Water chestnuts and potatoes. Loved their quantity and taste.Coming to the drinks, my other friends said their beers were great. I drank mocktails. Few of them were good some were average.Their desserts are limited. But does have a twist. Their chocolate lava cake is good.They do have a super private dining area that can accommodate 10 people. Sure worth the try.For more follow us on Instagram at platewithflavours.']),\n",

The grilled chicken was truly amazing, soft and juicy meat well seasoned but not overspicy. The Afghani tikka was tasty with mildly spiced but lot of flavour. Shawarma roll is a must try as it was packed with juicy meat rather than just the veggies. The rumali roti was however a let down as it was not freshly prepared and hence became crisp n crumbly.

Instead they wrote the balance amount on the bill put a sign with stamp and told me to use this amount to buy other stuff within 1 month. I mean is it so difficult to return the remaining amount or at least give flexibility to use that amount anytime. Really disappointed with chef bakers.'],\n",

       "   \"This is typical darshini hotel which serves mainly south indian food, though north Indian and Chinese is also available. One can opt for self service on ground floor, whereas service is available on 1st floor.Coming to food, South indian fare is better than north indian. This is based on number of visits made by us earlier. All Dosas, rava idli and South Indian delicacies are above average in taste, whereas north indian food is very inconsistent. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's bad. Service is quite slow since most of the tables are empty, atleast on weekdays, though decent crowd can be seen downstairs for self service.This place doesn't serve anything extraordinary but nevertheless south indian food is quite ok and can visit this place once in a while. Avoid their service section which is too slow for comfort and often seen staff getting changed.My final summary of this restaurant.Food - 3.0, (3.5 for South Indian and 2.5 for North)Ambience - 3.5VFM - 4.5Service -...                                        read more\"]),\n",

We decided to try the crab sticks, prawns fry, beef (made on the rock) and sheekh kebab. The place was packed and it took us 15 mins to get our food packed.
