Monster freak shake is one the main highlight of this place.', 'This is theme cafe \nU will remember ur school days memories \nTheir menu book was like school books \nCheese nachos was good \nChill paneer was yummy \nUnicorn freak shakes must try \nIf ur chocolate lover try chocolate shake', 'A very unique restaurant with a theme which would transport you to your childhood. The restaurant has been themed in such a way that everything is in sync with school, right from the menu card which is like a class copy to the cutlery being kept in a pencil box, to the Tom and Jerry being played on the TV, one would love it. The food too is lovely. Chicken Stroganoff was delicious. Another interesting thing is the bill comes in the format of a report card ;) Really enjoyed the visit.']"

The moment we tooked the order the entire place was filled with aroma ! The packaging too was perfect and fancy\n\nWe ordered\nPaneer subz biryani and falafel .\nThe falafel were the usual ones , spot on , fried well ! They were crunchy and tasted really good .\nThen we tried the biryani which was filled with aroma and lots of indian spices . It was absolutely delicious serve with some raita . The paneer too was good , just a bit overpowering the flavours were but it was amazing\nAlso to end the dish they gave us gulab jamoon which was a nice way to end the meal !\n\nFood packaging - 4.5/5\nFood - 4/5\nService - 4/5', 'FOOD REVIEW III\n\nBehrouz has always been one of my favourite place to have biriyani from. This time I ordered Gosht biriyani with chicken kebabs.\nThe food was hot when delivered and the aroma of the biriyani filled the house.\nThe aroma literally made me have my dinner earlier that usual but to my surprise the biriyani failed to impress me. In a previous instance I had biriyani from here and it absolutely made me fall in love but this time it was different. Quantity wise really good. Personally didnt like the taste. Felt like the gravy was too much put even though the meat was tender.\nThe murg koobidehs were not remarkable either. Somehow they lacked the taste. To me they were bland. No chutney was given with the kebabs which I really found strange.\n\nOverall not that great an experience.', ""I had ordered Lazeez Bhuna Murg Biryani and Murg Kefta.\nThe Murg Kefta was well cooked and tastes really good will the mint chutney provided. You can squeeze lemon if it suits your tastebuds.\nThe Biryani is certainly a meal for 2 after having the starter. It is cooked with great care and probably the best Biryani I've ordered at home."", 'Got this delivered as a part of food review program and Behrouz manages to be one place that nullifies the concept that veg biryani is a myth. the paneer biryani tastes just so good. The appetizer and the choco lava cake that came with it just added to the happiness.', 'Got this delivery from Behrouz Biryani at Old Airport Road. Absolutely loved the place. I got two items which were both absolute lit!\n1. Zaikedaar Paneer Biryani\nwhich comes with mint raita and a Gulab jamun.\nBiryani is one of the best, I‚Äôve ever had. It comes in a great packaging with good quantity which is enough for one person. Mint Raita goes extremely well with the Biryani. Highly recommended for vegetarian people.\n\n2. Falafal-e-Khaas\nA very delicious and perfect ‚Äúsides‚Äù one can have with a Biryani. It comes with a lemon and a Chatni which makes it more delicious.', ""Ordered Chicken Biryani recently from Behrouz. My second time trying their food, it has surely lowered in standards.\n\nThe biryani wasn't the best. It had a weird perfume flavour to it which wasn't appealing. However, chicken was well cooked.\n\nVeg Falafel was not great. Tasted quite stale.\n\nDelivery was delayed by a bit but overall, wasn't the best experience."", '‚ñ∂Ô∏èOrdered the dum ghosht biryani and the chicken koobideh from the outlet\n\nThe delivery was on timeüëçüèº\nThe temperature of the food was optimal üëå\nThe delivery was packaged well with cutlery providedüòç\n\nComing to the taste, having tried Behrouz earlier, they are consistent and renowned for the flavor of the biryani.

My sister learning from the prof got it freshly made for us. I had the bread with Missal & bhaji that same day. It was so good. Next day I had the complete pleasure of tasting just the sour dough without anything in my office. Omg!!! It was so yummy. I ate half the bread trying to hide from others to eat in working hours. The sundried tomatoes and olives was making my heart giggle with each bite. That day, the bread lover in me was happy and content. Must try the amazing sourdough by Krumbkraft.']"
