Was pretty crowded but luckily a table freed up and we were seated. The ambience is very nice and comforting and their staff is very kind and courteous as well.\n\nBetween 3 people we ordered 1 Triple Chicken Pizza and 1 Chicken Lasagna. The pizza was pretty filling and tasted nice. Not anything out of the ordinary, but still definitely nice.\n\nThe Lasagna on the other hand was poor, had a small portion which hardly had any filling. Lacked seasoning and the Lasagna sheets were extremely over cooked. I could mainly taste the cheese and that was pretty much it.\n\nThey have a large selection of board/card games which can be played while waiting for your food or while eating it which is honestly very fun.

I was amazed seeing the collection that they had since most of the board games were new to me.\nThe ambience is warm and cheerful with everyone involved in games. \nOn coming to the food part, it is fine. Had tri chicken pizza, penne creamy sauce pasta and grilled chicken steak sizzler, along with cheese cake and mojito... the pizza was nice and the pasta was nice too.. while the sizzler was okay. Cheese cake was not upto the mark while mojito was fine.\nThe service is slow. But when u r engrossed in your game, u would not notice it much.\nPricing is also on the reasonable side and would recommend trying out this place!', 'The vibe of this place is fun, funky and cool. So many board games to choose from! However, as for the food, that was underwhelming. The hot chocolate wasn‚Äôt good. Blue lagoon was okayish. Not enough fizz and the penne creamy pasta in white sauce was sweet which was somewhat disappointing. Music and ambience are a plus though.', 'Great food with decent portions. The ambience is good, especially after the recent revamp. We order the chicken pizza (gigantic), club sandwich and a chicken pockets appetizer. We also ordered drinks- Irish coffee, hot chocolate and green apple ice tea. Every dish on the table was good and the service was prompt. This place also houses many board games as well as card games like uno. So, you can chill with friends over food as well as some games.A good place to spend a lazy afternoon.']"," 2009  votes

As the name suggests its known for its crispy falafel and middle eastern food. Ordering at the counter is very easy and simple and it‚Äôs like a fast food chain system but healthy food... I liked the falafel platter a lot. The pita with dips was also good but I liked the hummus the most in it..\n\nRolls are large and fill you up easily. Burger was also nice. But both roll and burger was little bland to taste.\nLemonade and grape juice were awesome, very fresh and tasty \nPrice is very cheap and everyone can afford. Quantity and quality is great for that price.. value for money. Give it a go', 'I enjoyed the Big meal which came with Bread, falafel n hummus, however, did not enjoy the pocket which was very dry. \n\nComing to the price, I think they are very decently priced and the hummus is tasty. Surprisingly, their drinks were superb, even the basic Lemonade was awesome. So, if ur working around CMH, run down their for a quick meal and get back to work üòä', 'The place is very neatly maintained and one of the best & clean open kitchen that I have ever noticed !!! The staffs are so friends and the interiors looks so classic and elegant. Now talking about the food this place is exclusively for authentic Mediterranean street food, fresh, affordable, quick and healthy falafel rolls and sandwiches.\n\nAt Habibi Falafel we get the most authentic falafel that one can find & also the freshest. Everything is homemade, from their falafel balls, which are fried to perfection right before your eyes the moment you order, freshly cut veggies of your choice from the salad bar, homemade hummus, mutabbal, tahina and pita bread is always baked fresh daily.\n\nThey also pickle their our own cucumbers, carrots and green chilis to make sure everything is natural, healthy & tasty', 'A nice small place on Indranagar main road, for Falafel. People from gulf will probably relate to this food.\nWent with a friend for dinner, and ordered the Falafel Plate. The quantity was great, and we shared it, the salad was fresh, so was the hummus with fresh pita bread. Even the Falafel balls was well made.\nFor drink alongside it,we had Lemonana mint lemonade and orange, which was again fresh and a great with the main course.\nThe service was fast and friendly. The ambience was also great, with well adorned walls and nice lights.', ""The food here was so so good. If hummus and pita bread are the kind of foods that get you excited, you have to try it out. They have a falafel version of various fast food variants, but their falafel plate is their best seller. It's for good reason - they have great pita bread, falafel that's perfectly crispy and three dips. The hummus is perfect, and the baba ganoush is accurate. The best part about this place is when you dine in, almost everything is below ‚Çπ100. That makes for a filling meal at such a cheap price. It's a definite must try and I'll be going back here often!"", 'Well the food might be good but it was not my type. I ordered the Falafel Plate which was tasty and plate full. And then I made a mistake of ordering Hummus Fatteh which was no good for me.\n\nOverall I would rate it as an average restaurant though the interiors and the staff were quite helpful.', 'We were invited to review this restaurant so we tried mint lemonade , grape juice , Falafel platter , Falafel salad and baklava. Everything tasted amazing and yet it was so affordable. The staff are really nice too. Must visit place for all Lebanese food lovers.', ""I ordered food from this outlet for home delivery through zomato. The potato thing had fungus and they were smelly as well as the strings were coming out of it, I tried one piece and I knew this has no life left...how can a restaurant do that to a customer and send them such food. Guys be cautious when you visit this place, looks like they don't have customers and that's why they are sending rotten food."", 'If you are looking for vegan/healthy food, this is the place for it. Also its near to Indiranagar metro.\nStaff is very friendly and they provide good service.\nAmbience is good as well and they place arab music.\n\nThings i ordered :\n1. Falafel plate - It had falafel balls and hummus. 4.8/5\n2. Pita chips and dips - 4.5/5\n3. Ordered juices as well. They were good for the prices.\n4. Burger - Burger was good as well.\n5. For dessert, ordered Bakalva. Bakalva is the dessert pastry. Must try dish here. Would recommend to everyone.\n\nThey serve middle eastern street food in their authentic All the dishes are completely healthy, vegan. Do visit this place. They also have a branch in Koramangala.\nRating - 4.8/5', 'Some great food being served at this restaurant. Everything was made fresh and served hot! The ambience is nice with some Arab tunes playing in the background. They also serve quite a few vegan dishes. Will definitely be going back here. üòÅ']"," Based on 86 votes

Cobaja is just a small joint on a 2 storey building, with very limited seating, which may get crowded and noisy. And there is nothing special about the ambience and service by staffs are below AVERAGE. Above all, the portion of squid fries, prawns ghee roast etc were very minimal.\nHighly recommend the management to rethink either about portion size or pricing.', ""This place is definitely going to catch your eyes when it comes to its interior.. Very calm and peaceful setup with light colors. These guys serve fish and chicken thali at a reasonable price with no compromise on taste.\nBeing in Richmond road it's tough to get good food places here at a reasonable price and hence this will definitely be an attractive option.\nAmazing fish thalis, amazing chicken thalis and awesome well cooked mutton thali.\nJust go for this place without thinking twice.\nU will love the low sitting arrangments.\nOverall a great experience.\nWill definitely go here again and would highly recommend this place to everyone."", ""While exploring bridge road, got my eyes on this place Cobaja. They had this food festival going on which I tried and was super Delicious.\nFrom the starters to main course to dessert every thing was full of flavours and worth trying.\nI love the ghee roast chicken and prawns. Ordered the mutton balls which were absolutely yummm.\nIn main course I loveeed the chicken pulav and chicken Karan the most. Their mutton was so soft and juicy, just melts in your mouth. Amazing and worth trying.\nI highly recommend the food here and also the service is worth appreciation. If you have never been to this place, definitely make your visit cause I'm sure for all non veg lovers, food here won't disappoint you at all.""]"," 279  votes

Apart from the price factor, the place doesn't disappoint."", ""The mackerel fish curry and rice stole the show for me.\nThe fried mackerel wasn't that well with the burnt and overdose of spices.\nI think they can improve it.\n\nBut the basic fish curry and rice is a must must try for all visiting here.\n\nCheers\nPMThefoodie""]"," 924  votes

I order the Picante Paneer pizza from the supreme pizzas and Corn and Olive Bruschetta along with it this time.\n\nPizza had a great tangy, kind of spicy and really flavourful taste into each bite.\xa0It‚Äôs a decent 9"" pizza for the price they offer you at, and can easily make 2 people tummy full. It\'s great for quality and also the quantity. They have good consistency and pizza base is not too chewy too.\n\nThe delivery was dot on time, served piping hot and the pizza tasted amazing! But Bruschetta was not so great and was little bland. Have never tried their deserts and would definitely give it a try pretty soon.\n\nI would definitely recommend this for pizza lovers or any food lover in general for the amazing pizzas. Lots of love to Oven story!', 'Recently ordered a Farmfresh Supreme pizza while lazying around on a holiday. I was skeptical given my bad experience in the past. To my surprise, the services have improved very much. First of all, the crust is way better, the toppings have been meticulously decorated and makes pizza look soo good and delicious. The overall taste is great and can easily be finished in minutes and not worry about it getting cold.\xa0\n\nThey can improve on the cutting part of the pizza as I had a little difficulty over getting the slice out each time and apart from that overall it has been an improvement from the previous time from a different outlet.\xa0\n\nAlso, their cheese infused garlic bread is just sooo juicy and sinful and so is the choco lava dessert.', ""Oven story is one of my favourite places.It's best known for its pizza and different types of cheese.You can customise your own pizza by choosing from their wide variety of cheese.\nI ordered famous five pizza with tandoori cheese and it was the best thin crust pizza i ever had.I would like to recommend y'all to try this place out"", ""Here's to next level cheese pizza!\nI ordered double chicken loaded pizza...and trust me it was not only loaded with chicken but cheesee too. Ovenstory is soon going to be the next pizza hut!\nThe base is thin and they put corns which makes the pizza a perfect thing to snack on!\nI couldnt finish one 10inch pizza alone, so be sure its gonna fulfil two people at ease!\nOrder directly from the website they got crazy offers there!"", ""If you have craving for pizza don't think twice, can order from ovenstory. They are ontime in delivering, good packaging & variety of menu. As they have standard 9 inch pizza which is enough for 2 people, ordered one double chicken feast pizza with chitpole cheese along with choco lava cake. Pizza was hot when it was delivered to me. Toppings were well spread along with loads of cheese. Have to try other pizzas which are on their menu.."", 'I was approached by the Oven Story team for a review. And their pizza truly exceeded my expectations.\n\nFirstly, the food arrived way before the scheduled time. They delivered 20 minutes early and the pizza was piping hot. I opted for Picante Paneer Pizza, but what came in as a surprise was the Corn and Olives Mac n Cheese and Chocolate Fantasy cake that was sent along with it.\n\nI absolutely loved everything. The Mac n Cheese was loaded with corn and olives and was extremely cheesy. The pizza had a bunch of toppings and the paneer was soft.\nIt was one of those melt in the mouth sort of pizzas! üòç', ""Ovenstory Pizza predominantly deals with pizzas. They have four different pizza categories. Each of these categories is further divided into various pizzas from which you can take your pick.\n\nThey have brought their pizza toppings to some next level ingredients. We ordered for the Famous Five Pizza which was a big 10' inch cheese burst pizza comprising of various veggies like bell peppers, jalape√±os, corn and onions over a delicious sauce base and loads of melting mozzarella cheese. One must really try their pizzas as they are truly cheesy and crustworthy. The best part about the pizza is its yummy crust and the perfect sauce on the base. The pizza is quite cheesy and portion size adequate for two.\xa0\n\nBon App√©tit."", ""If you love your pizzas loaded with cheese, look no further than Ovenstory!\n\nI recently tried their picante paneer pizza and cheesy garlic bread and both arrived, loaded with cheese. üßÄ\n\nThe pizza was delivered piping hot, and packed really well.\n\nThe sauce and toppings were generous, and the pizza tasted goood!\n\nThe garlic bread was also stuffed with mozarella, and came with a cheese dip.\n\nDefinitely worth a try when you're craving for some pizza! üçï"", ""This place always impresses with its consistency of good quality and taste. With amazingly cooked pizza to the variety being offered, I mostly prefer keep trying different options from this place. This time I ordered:\n\nFamous five - Just perfect with 5 different exotic vegetables being used which makes it supr yum.\n\nGarlic bread- This is normally the safest item at any place which never fails to impress\n\nThe packing and delivery was on time which further added to the overall experience. The only suggestion would be to deliver it right when it's cooked as our food was less hot as compared to what it should be. Overall a nice option for pizza lovers.""]"," 51  votes

It‚Äôs nice looking at the setup for a snacks shop.\n\nThere is one pic at wall where a boy is looking at his mom cooking food.

We were hungry and thought of taking a dig. What we had was Aloo Paranth, which had a bowl full of curd and quite much of green salad served along. I liked particularly the plating which was entire wooden. Just hope the plates are clean enough as only disadvantage in these kind of plates is that you can not make out the cleanliness of crockery.\n\nTea which was served in kullhar ( earthen pot ) was good and strong too, boiled entirely in milk.\xa0\n\nFor the small raid, we were satisfied enough.', 'Today we visited this cafe (17th March, around 7:30pm). Ambience was good here but the food was literally pathetic. Never had such experience in any cafe before. We ordered biryani combo which consist of stale pulav(not even close to biryani, instead of naming it as biryani they should call it as veg pulav only) which was not at all fresh and the curd served with that was very sour. After requesting to change the curd the new piece of curd was okay sort of (not very good). The protein salad was also not fresh and the atta of paneer paratha served was sour and tasted very bad. I was really disappointed after visiting here. I hope in future they keep this point in mind and ll improve the quality of food.', 'Amazing food specially bread pakoda and onion pakoda with ginger teaüòçüòç!! but service was slow and thali is also a must try as it was simple and delicious.', 'Crap food.

It's now always how it sounds, as long as the basic notes are in place, it's about how it makes you feel.\n\nIndy's food would be that super relatable song by an unknown artist that just makes you feel a little better.\n\nIt's easy to get overwhelmed by restaurants in Kormangala, I mean how do you stand out with a thousand other restaurants at every corner? You don't, you just serve good food. And you get loyal customers like me :)\n\nIf it wasn't clear till this point, I liked the place, their parathas, chai and smoothies are great!""]"," 400  votes

It's been 5 yrs we always celebrate Onan at Ente Keralam. This yr also we were at Ente Keralam and it was not up to mark or just as every year. Disappointed with it and especially the payasams were horrible. It was water, no taste. Pathetic!! Though we had early lunch around 1.00pm, it was water. Never expected and was not satisfied this yr. Also the crowd was also not heavy this year. \n\nHope they will get back next year."", ""Amazing Sadhya Luncheon. It was served within minutes and tasted awesome. The yellow curry served by the side being the best. It's located bin heart of MG road Ulsoor area and just a walk from Taj where i am staying.

The food is as traditional as it gets and covers a wide variety in both veg and non veg. We took 2 sadhya meals and 1 neymeen polichathu. Great presentation of food. The kaachiya moru and payar curry in meals were delicious. Nice desserts as well.', ""An amazing option for dinner! The unlimited thali is such a great option. I enjoyed everything on the thali.

It comes with a lemon and a Chatni which makes it more delicious.', ""Ordered Chicken Biryani recently from Behrouz.

While the thali was enough and filling for one the quality wasn't as such."", ""The Channa batura I had here was so bad .The gravy was more like that of paneer butter masala and dint go well with Channa .\nAlso the sounth Indian food served here is not that great I would rather go to brahmin's cafe .\nReally disappointed with this place ."", 'Chariot is a good pure veg restaurant end of brigade road . They have good seating capacity. They offer both south n north Indian dishes. Descent pricing. I tried north Indian Thali mini. It only costed 100 bucks.

But I expected more in Thali dishes.', 'Reminded me of those regular Mumbai vegetarian restaurants I used to visit as a kid. It felt like they lathered an entire slab of butter over my naan.

Perhaps the only concern was that they don't have card swip facility which the owner has promised will be there when I visit next time. So I am gonna challenge by going tomorrow again, well not to check actually but to eat some good food. \nA must try eat out guys... And get a while new experience of food truck in bangalore."", 'Thoroughly enjoyed the food. Good veg options. Especially the veg burgers, which were awesome!

Great quality bacon with a fine choice of fillings and good amount of passion has gone into making this sub. Loved the juicy and the crunch the sub has to offer .

Delicately roasted with cajun or equivalent spices. Spinach was a good foil. Nice plating. Next was the entree. The steak was juicy, soft and paired with a simple tangy red wine sauce. Mushrooms and baked potatoes round off the experience. Zucchini, carrots and shallots bring in a bit of health, thus reducing the guilt. Quality of meat could improve. But that could be put down to a sourcing constraint. Korean grass fed or Angus Prime, is too much to ask. Dessert was a moist walnut cake. Not too sweet. A perfect meal. Great service.', 'Went for a late lunch at around 3:30....nice interiors ordered farmers market salad,double cheese burger,philly cheese beef pizza ,stir fried pepper steak and steak supreme and an apple pie.....the was nice', 'Case of a place which did not live up to the hype.

There was aloo laccha tokri, sabudana wada, aloo chips, jeera aloo, aloo gravy, paneer gravy, sabudana khichri, pumpkin halwa, rasmalai, shrikhand, curd, kuttu poori and lassi.\n\nThe flavours were really good, in comparison to other places where  I have tried the Navratri menu. Cooking with desi ghee just added charm to the whole spread. I found my joy in shrikhand, poori and halwa, simply yum!\n\nTotally worth trying, just two suggestions- \n\n1) I wish it was less oily. \n2) If they would incorporate other ingredients like raw banana for a gravy and not just potato- coz the whole thali seemed too ‚Äúpotatoey‚Äù. \nBut nevertheless, flavours just stole the show.\nService was courteous.\nLoved the experience .', 'The decor of the place is well done giving some authentic Rajasthani feel, with folk music playing in the background. Also, you could choose to sit in Rajasthani style with a baithak kind of setting or else opt for the regular chair table routine setup. Overall I would summarize the thaali as one with few hits and misses.\n\nA few of my fav picks from the whole thaali were Dahi Vada, Khichdi, Poori, aloo matar, and hot desserts. The rest of the items were average in taste. Dal Bati which is one of my favorites failed to lighten my palate.\nOne thing which was really commendable was their hospitality. The staff was attentive and equally after everyone till they were full till their necks. I would like to mention Mr. Krishna and Mr. Rakesh who were a great host.', 'This place is located in Indiranagar. This is a pure vegetarian place that servers authentic Rajasthani Thali. The thali is pretty huge and they are very generous with food. Their service is amazing. They feed you till your tummy explodes. They treat all their customers like family. It was a wonderful experience and the quality if food is just amazing. The thali had two chaats, two types of roti and poori and three desserts, rice , Kichdi, khadi, pickle, salad and so on. The ambience is pretty af and this place is good for family outings. This place is also really good with hygiene and everything. This is also a kid friendly place. They treat your kids really well too.', 'Recently visited NH8 for thei smaller portion of Thali during tuesday, must say that was mouthful of dishes for sure. Started off with the dahi vada which is super yumm & not to be missed.. Dal batti is very good here. However kichidi was very comforting in my plate which i relished with rajma curry... Gulab jamun is served hot is the best way to end my meal.. Not to miss the excellent hospitality & the seating NH8 have that makes me come here regularly', ""NH8 is one of the most authentic Rajasthani places I have seen in the recent times. All the staffs make you feel welcomed and serve you with utmost care.\n\nThey have unique seatings where a small mandir is also present and you've got to go there after removing your slippers.\n\nOnce you've settled down in the place the gigantic thali plate with sides are served to you‚ô•Ô∏è it's a visual treat to the eyes. You put on the turban and you are ready to devour the food! The thali is unlimited and they keep serving you even if you are full till neck üòã\n\nThey had served two types of rotis, 6 types of curries and dal, khicidi, khadi kachori, Dahi vada, buttermilk,pakodas, kala jamun, moong dal halwa and rasogolla.\n\nEverything was amazing ‚ô•Ô∏è overall a great experience will be back soon""]"," 2714  votes

They were quick with the food, however not quick with the fresh lime water and soda- which I believe is because of the separate kitchen who serve dessert and shawarmas- so there was a coordination gap.
