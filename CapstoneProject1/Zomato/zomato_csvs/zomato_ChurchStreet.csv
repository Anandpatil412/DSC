Had tri chicken pizza, penne creamy sauce pasta and grilled chicken steak sizzler, along with cheese cake and mojito... the pizza was nice and the pasta was nice too.. while the sizzler was okay. Cheese cake was not upto the mark while mojito was fine.\nThe service is slow.

So many board games to choose from! However, as for the food, that was underwhelming. The hot chocolate wasn‚Äôt good. Blue lagoon was okayish. Not enough fizz and the penne creamy pasta in white sauce was sweet which was somewhat disappointing. Music and ambience are a plus though.', 'Great food with decent portions. The ambience is good, especially after the recent revamp. We order the chicken pizza (gigantic), club sandwich and a chicken pockets appetizer. We also ordered drinks- Irish coffee, hot chocolate and green apple ice tea. Every dish on the table was good and the service was prompt. This place also houses many board games as well as card games like uno. So, you can chill with friends over food as well as some games.A good place to spend a lazy afternoon.']"

As the name suggests its known for its crispy falafel and middle eastern food. Ordering at the counter is very easy and simple and it‚Äôs like a fast food chain system but healthy food... I liked the falafel platter a lot. The pita with dips was also good but I liked the hummus the most in it..\n\nRolls are large and fill you up easily. Burger was also nice. But both roll and burger was little bland to taste.\nLemonade and grape juice were awesome, very fresh and tasty \nPrice is very cheap and everyone can afford. Quantity and quality is great for that price.. value for money. Give it a go', 'I enjoyed the Big meal which came with Bread, falafel n hummus, however, did not enjoy the pocket which was very dry. \n\nComing to the price, I think they are very decently priced and the hummus is tasty. Surprisingly, their drinks were superb, even the basic Lemonade was awesome.

The staffs are so friends and the interiors looks so classic and elegant. Now talking about the food this place is exclusively for authentic Mediterranean street food, fresh, affordable, quick and healthy falafel rolls and sandwiches.\n\nAt Habibi Falafel we get the most authentic falafel that one can find & also the freshest. Everything is homemade, from their falafel balls, which are fried to perfection right before your eyes the moment you order, freshly cut veggies of your choice from the salad bar, homemade hummus, mutabbal, tahina and pita bread is always baked fresh daily.\n\nThey also pickle their our own cucumbers, carrots and green chilis to make sure everything is natural, healthy & tasty', 'A nice small place on Indranagar main road, for Falafel. People from gulf will probably relate to this food.\nWent with a friend for dinner, and ordered the Falafel Plate. The quantity was great, and we shared it, the salad was fresh, so was the hummus with fresh pita bread. Even the Falafel balls was well made.\nFor drink alongside it,we had Lemonana mint lemonade and orange, which was again fresh and a great with the main course.\nThe service was fast and friendly. The ambience was also great, with well adorned walls and nice lights.', ""The food here was so so good. If hummus and pita bread are the kind of foods that get you excited, you have to try it out. They have a falafel version of various fast food variants, but their falafel plate is their best seller. It's for good reason - they have great pita bread, falafel that's perfectly crispy and three dips. The hummus is perfect, and the baba ganoush is accurate. The best part about this place is when you dine in, almost everything is below ‚Çπ100. That makes for a filling meal at such a cheap price. It's a definite must try and I'll be going back here often!"", 'Well the food might be good but it was not my type. I ordered the Falafel Plate which was tasty and plate full. And then I made a mistake of ordering Hummus Fatteh which was no good for me.\n\nOverall I would rate it as an average restaurant though the interiors and the staff were quite helpful.', 'We were invited to review this restaurant so we tried mint lemonade , grape juice , Falafel platter , Falafel salad and baklava.

The overall taste is great and can easily be finished in minutes and not worry about it getting cold.\xa0\n\nThey can improve on the cutting part of the pizza as I had a little difficulty over getting the slice out each time and apart from that overall it has been an improvement from the previous time from a different outlet.\xa0\n\nAlso, their cheese infused garlic bread is just sooo juicy and sinful and so is the choco lava dessert.', ""Oven story is one of my favourite places.It's best known for its pizza and different types of cheese.You can customise your own pizza by choosing from their wide variety of cheese.\nI ordered famous five pizza with tandoori cheese and it was the best thin crust pizza i ever had.I would like to recommend y'all to try this place out"", ""Here's to next level cheese pizza!\nI ordered double chicken loaded pizza...and trust me it was not only loaded with chicken but cheesee too.

The pizza had a bunch of toppings and the paneer was soft.\nIt was one of those melt in the mouth sort of pizzas! üòç', ""Ovenstory Pizza predominantly deals with pizzas. They have four different pizza categories. Each of these categories is further divided into various pizzas from which you can take your pick.\n\nThey have brought their pizza toppings to some next level ingredients. We ordered for the Famous Five Pizza which was a big 10' inch cheese burst pizza comprising of various veggies like bell peppers, jalape√±os, corn and onions over a delicious sauce base and loads of melting mozzarella cheese. One must really try their pizzas as they are truly cheesy and crustworthy. The best part about the pizza is its yummy crust and the perfect sauce on the base. The pizza is quite cheesy and portion size adequate for two.\xa0\n\nBon App√©tit."", ""If you love your pizzas loaded with cheese, look no further than Ovenstory!\n\nI recently tried their picante paneer pizza and cheesy garlic bread and both arrived, loaded with cheese. üßÄ\n\nThe pizza was delivered piping hot, and packed really well.\n\nThe sauce and toppings were generous, and the pizza tasted goood!\n\nThe garlic bread was also stuffed with mozarella, and came with a cheese dip.\n\nDefinitely worth a try when you're craving for some pizza! üçï"", ""This place always impresses with its consistency of good quality and taste. With amazingly cooked pizza to the variety being offered, I mostly prefer keep trying different options from this place. This time I ordered:\n\nFamous five - Just perfect with 5 different exotic vegetables being used which makes it supr yum.\n\nGarlic bread- This is normally the safest item at any place which never fails to impress\n\nThe packing and delivery was on time which further added to the overall experience.

The food is as traditional as it gets and covers a wide variety in both veg and non veg. We took 2 sadhya meals and 1 neymeen polichathu. Great presentation of food. The kaachiya moru and payar curry in meals were delicious. Nice desserts as well.', ""An amazing option for dinner! The unlimited thali is such a great option. I enjoyed everything on the thali. I'm definitely going here again for another (hopefully) great experience. Another thing - the servers here are extremely sweet and helpful, which was very refreshing to see.""]"

Me and my friends went to Somilan Steak house during the late lunch hours but still we faced the unexpected crowd which was reflected in the quality of service provided! However the staffs did apologize for the poor service.\nComing to the food, I experienced best Chinese food here and was very much satisfied with the taste and quality. Quantity is also decent. Cost range for steaks is obviously high but for Chinese main course it is pocket friendly and zomato gold is worth using in this outlet.\nDecor is posh and the outlet is located just outside the mg road metro station!\nIt's highly recommend if you are looking for good restaurants in Church Street."", 'All I can say about this place is that they have got the best north eastern food. Thukpa served there is so awesome that I went again just to have it again. The taste is irresistible with its super affordable prices. Both quantity and quality of the food will woo you for sure. The interiors are typical naga style with naga ancestors photographs which gives it a tribal look. Being a north eastern I just loved this place but I am sure you will like it too, just have a try. They have also got great beverages which taste wonderful, goes well with the food.', 'This quaint restaurant in church street turned out to be a brilliant delight. I ordered pork fried rice and pork hoison and the taste was great but the quantity was amazing.']"
